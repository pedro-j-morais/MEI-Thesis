## 📋 Abstract

The falsification of identification documents presents a remarkable threat to public security, personal data protection, and fraud prevention. A growing concern within this domain is the use of **morphed facial images**, a deceptive technique that has become more prevalent with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and image processing technologies.

**Morphed images** are created by blending the facial features of two or more individuals to create a composite image that resembles all contributors. This manipulation enables multiple individuals to use a single identification document, for example, to gain unauthorized access across international borders.

Detecting these morphed images poses a considerable challenge. Humans are often unable to detect the manipulation, and even advanced facial recognition systems struggle to identify these sophisticated attacks. This thesis investigates **deep learning techniques for Morphing Attack Detection (MAD)**, with a particular focus on:

- Evaluating state-of-the-art MAD approaches across diverse datasets
- Exploring **Vision Transformer (ViT)** architectures for morphing detection
- Developing **occlusion-based interpretability methods** to understand model decision-making
- Analyzing the robustness of detection methods under various morphing techniques
- Identifying critical facial regions for accurate morphing detection

## 🎯 Research Objectives

This thesis addresses the following key research questions:

1. **How can deep learning techniques be used to improve Morphing Attack Detection?**
2. **What are the challenges in detecting sophisticated morphing attacks?**
3. **How can we improve model interpretability and explainability in MAD systems?**
4. **Which facial regions are most critical for accurate morphing detection?**

The research focuses on:
- Replicating and evaluating existing MAD methods from recent literature
- Investigating Vision Transformers as an underexplored architecture for MAD
- Developing novel occlusion-based interpretability techniques
- Benchmarking performance across multiple datasets and morphing techniques
- Analyzing generalization capabilities across different attack types

### 2. **Methodology-Contribution/**
Contains the **original contribution** of this thesis: a complete pipeline for occlusion-based interpretability analysis of MAD models.

**Core Components:**

#### **crop_dataset_builder.py**
Prepares clean, standardized datasets by cropping and resizing facial images using MTCNN face detection. Ensures consistent face regions across all images before occlusion experiments.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic face detection and cropping
- Preserves folder structure
- Multiprocessing support for large datasets
- Detailed logging

#### **occlusion_dataset_builder.py**
Generates occluded variants of facial images to test MAD model robustness under controlled occlusion scenarios.

**Occlusion Types:**
- **Grid-Based**: Divides face into R×C grid and occludes one cell at a time
- **Landmark-Based**: Uses Dlib 68-point facial landmarks to occlude semantic regions (eyes, nose, mouth)

**Key Features:**
- Flexible occlusion modes (grid, landmark, or both)
- Automatic Dlib model download
- Multiprocessing support
- Preserves dataset structure

#### **occlusion_heatmaps_builder.py**
Creates visual heatmaps that highlight which facial regions influence the model's predictions most.

**Key Features:**
- Combines grid and landmark occlusion scores
- Generates composite heatmaps overlaid on original images
- Supports multiple visualization modes (raw scores or difference from baseline)
- Identifies vulnerable facial regions for MAD systems

**End-to-End Workflow:**
1. **Crop** → Use `crop_dataset_builder.py` to obtain standardized face crops
2. **Occlude** → Use `occlusion_dataset_builder.py` to generate occluded variants
3. **Predict** → Pass images through MAD model to produce prediction scores
4. **Visualize** → Use `occlusion_heatmaps_builder.py` to create interpretability heatmaps

## 🔬 Key Findings

### Deep Learning Techniques for MAD

1. **Feature Extraction**: CNNs and Vision Transformers effectively automate feature extraction, identifying subtle manipulation traces that traditional methods miss

2. **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining multiple feature types (high-frequency, RGB, wavelet domain) improves detection accuracy across different morphing techniques

3. **Vision Transformers**: ViT-based architectures show competitive performance and strong potential for MAD applications, though remain underexplored in the literature

4. **Generalization Challenges**: Models often struggle with cross-dataset and cross-technique generalization, particularly with unseen morphing methods

5. **Image Type Variations**: Digital images yield better detection results than Print & Scan (P&S) images, which are common in real-world passport verification scenarios

### Model Interpretability

The occlusion-based interpretability method developed in this thesis reveals:

- **Critical Facial Regions**: Mouth and central nose areas are typically most important for model predictions
- **Spatial Dependencies**: Grid-based occlusion provides fine-grained understanding of spatial importance
- **Semantic Regions**: Landmark-based occlusion identifies which facial features (eyes, nose, mouth) contribute most to detection
- **Model Transparency**: Heatmap visualizations enhance trust and auditability in security-critical applications
